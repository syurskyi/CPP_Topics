Exercise 1.

Declare a variable "a" and initialize it with any value. Then create a pointer variable "p" 
containing the address of the variable "a". Print out in the console the value and address
of the variable "a" using both variable "a" and pointer "p".

eg.
Output:

Value of the variable a is equal to: 5
The address of the variable a is equal to: 0x69fef8
The value stored in the pointer p is equal to: 0x69fef8
To get the value of the variable a using pointer p one has to point to the address in the pointer p, *p = 5

Exercise 2.

Edit the code from the first exercise. Create another pointer "pp" containing the address 
of the pointer variable "p". Print out in the console the value and address of the variable
"a" using variable "a" and pointers "p" and "pp". Furthermore, print out the value and address
of the pointer "P" using pointers "p" and "pp".


eg.
Output:
Value of the variable a is equal to: 5
The address of the variable a is equal to: 0x69fef8
The value stored in the pointer p is equal to: 0x69fef8
To get the value of the variable a using pointer p one has to point to the address in the pointer p, *p = 5

Pointer p has its own address which is: 0x69fef4
The value stored in the pointer pp is equal to: 0x69fef4
To get the value of the pointer p using pointer pp one has to point to the address in the pointer pp, *pp = 0x69fef8
To get the value of he variable a using pointer pp one has to point to the address in the pointer pp and p, **pp = 5
