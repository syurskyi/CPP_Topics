Exercise 1.

Write a program that asks the user to input a PIN code for the first time. Then using
the while (or do while) loop ask the user to input the PIN code again. If the PIN code is 
wrong, the user should input it again (until the number is correct).


eg.

User inputted:
PIN: 3333
CHECKPIN: 3341

Output:
Input your pin: 

eg.

User inputted:
PIN: 3412
CHECKPIN: 3412

Output:
Correct PIN !

Exercise 2.

Modify exercise 1 in order to stop the program if the PIN code was entered wrongly 5 times.
The user should be informed how many tries are left.

eg.

User inputted:
PIN: 3333
CHECKPIN: 3412

Output:
Input your pin (4 tries left): 


User inputted:
PIN: 3333
CHECKPIN: (wrong number 5 times)

Output:
You have entered a wrong PIN code for 5 times !
