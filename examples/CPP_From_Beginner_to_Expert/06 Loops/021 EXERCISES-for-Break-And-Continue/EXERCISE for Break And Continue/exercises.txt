Exercise 1.

Write a program that asks the user to input an integer number. Then the program calculates
the sum of all even numbers up to the number that the user inputted. Use continue instruction
to leave all odd numbers.

eg.

User inputted:
12

Output:
0 + 2 = 2
2 + 4 = 6
6 + 6 = 12
12 + 8 = 20
20 + 10 = 30
30 + 12 = 42

Exercise 2.

Write a program that shows the user current sum of numbers (starting with 0). Then it asks if
the user wants to add next number (raising by 1 in an infinite loop). If the user inputs Y or y
it adds the said number. If the user inputs N or n the number is skipped and gets incremented
by 1 (continue). If the user inputs anything else then Y/y or N/n the loop closes (break).

eg.

Output:
The current sum is: 0.
Do you want to add 1 ? 

User inputted:
N/n

Output:
The current sum is: 0.
Do you want to add 2 ?

User inputted:
Y/y

Output:
The current sum is: 2.
Do you want to add 3 ?
