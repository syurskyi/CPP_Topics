Exercise 1.

Basing on the knowledge about conditional statements, once again
modify the exercise from the lecture about logical and relational operators.
Write a program that asks the user to input three integer numbers. 
The first two should represent the minimum and maximum value of the interval 
respectively. Then the program should check if the third number is contained within the interval. 
The user should be informed if the number belongs or if it doesn't belong to the interval.

eg.

User inputted:
Minimum value: 5
Maximum value: 9
Value to check: 2

Output:
The number 2 doesn't belong to the interval from 5 to 9.

eg.

User inputted:
Minimum value: 2
Maximum value: 5
Value to check 3

Output:
The number 3 belongs to the interval from 2 to 5.


Exercise 2.

Modify the Exercise 1 in order to prevent a situation where maximum value inputted is lower than the
minimum value. The user should see an error. And the program should stop.

eg.

User Inputted:
Minimum value: 3
Maximum value: 2

Output: 
Error. Maximum value cannot be lower than the minimum value.


Exercise 3.

Write a program immitating a vending machine. The program should present the user 
with a choice of 6 products of your choice (Coke, Water, Chocolate Bar etc). Then allow 
the user to choose a product by entering a number 1-6. Add an exception for invalid input
if the user inputs a number which doesn't correspond to any choice.

eg.

1. Cola
2. Chocolate Bar
3. ...
4. ...
5. ...
6. ...

User inputted:
Choice: 2

Output:
Your have chosen a Chocolate Bar.

eg.

User inputted:
Choice: 7

Output:
Error. Invalid choice.
