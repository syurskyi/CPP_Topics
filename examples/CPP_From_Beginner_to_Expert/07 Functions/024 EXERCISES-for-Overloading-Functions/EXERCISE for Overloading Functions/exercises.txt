Exercise 1.

Initialize three variables with different types (int, double, string). Write a function 
"variableType" and overload it two times. Each three overloaded functions should take as
an argument different type of variable eg. variableType(int), variableType(double),
variableType(string). Send the variables created in the beginning to the variableType
function with corresponding type of argument and print out in the screen information
about what type of variable was used.

eg.
Output:
2 - this variable was an integer
0.123 - this variable was a double
"What a beautiful day" - this variable was a string


Exercise 2.

Write a program that asks the user how many values should get added together (from 2 to 5).
Then the user should input those numbers. Write a function "addition" that takes two double
parameters and adds them together, printing out in the console the calculation. Furthermore
overload the "addition" function 3 times so it takes three parameters, four parameters and
five parameters adding those parameters in each case. Prepare a switch that uses the version
of addition function with as many parameters as the user inputted at the beginning.

eg.

User inputted:
3

Output:
Input 1 Number.
Input 2 Number.
Input 3 Number.

User inputted:
2
3
4

Output:
2 + 3 + 4 = 9

PS Keep in mind that this exercise can be solved better than the given solution when you have more knowledge of C++. Better solution will be shown in future lessons.
