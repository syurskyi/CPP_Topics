Exercise 1.

Write a program that asks the user to input an integer number. Then starting from that
number the program prints out in the console next 100 numbers.

eg.

User inputted:
11

Output:
12
13
14
15
...
...
111


Exercise 2.

Write a program that prints out in the console all upper case and lower case letters from
the alphabet (A-Z).

eg.

Output:
A a B b C c D d E e F f G g H h I i J j K k L l M m N n O o P p Q q R r S s T t U u V v W w X x Y y Z z


Exercise 3.

Write a program that asks the user to input any number (integer or floating point) and
the n-th power (integer) the number should be raised to. Then calculate the result of the
exponentiation of this number to the said power.

eg.

User inputted:
Number: 2
N-th power: 5

Output:
The number 2 to the power of 5 is equal to 32.


Exercise 4.

Write a program that asks the user to input any integer number n. Then calculate the result
of the factorial operation (n! - 1*2*3*...*n). Print in the console result of the n factorial
as well as the factorial of numbers before n.

eg.

User inputted:
4

Output:
1! = 1
2! = 2
3! = 6
4! = 24

Exercise 5.

Write a program that asks the user to input an integer number. Then the program should print out
in the console the inputted number of asterisks (*). Furthermore, it should break the line (endl)
every 5 asterisks printed.

eg.

User inputted:
20

Output:
*****
*****
*****
*****

Exercise 6.

Write a program that asks the user to input 5 integer numbers (store them in a 5 element array).
Then it checks if the inputted numbers were odd or even and prints that information out in the console.

eg.

User inputted:
1
2
3
4
5

Output:
The number 1 is odd.
The number 2 is even.
The number 3 is odd.
The number 4 is even.
The number 5 is odd.
