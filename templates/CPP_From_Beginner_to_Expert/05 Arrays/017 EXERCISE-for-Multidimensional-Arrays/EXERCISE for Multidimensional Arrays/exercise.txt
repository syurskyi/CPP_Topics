Exercise 1.
Create a two dimensional 3x3 array of integers that holds some numbers of your choice (each array cell should be
initialised in program).

Write a program that asks the user to input x and y numbers (from 1 to 3). The program prints out
in the console the value that is stored in the array cell numbered by x, y coordinates. 
Take into consideration that coordinates starts counting from ONE when array starts counting from ZERO.

eg.

User inputted:
x: 2
y: 2

Output:
cout << array[1][1];
