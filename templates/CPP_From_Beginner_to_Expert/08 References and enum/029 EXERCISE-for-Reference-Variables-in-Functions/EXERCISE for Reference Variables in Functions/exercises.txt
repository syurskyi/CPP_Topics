Exercise 1.

Write a function called "setValue" which takes one integer argument. The function should
ask the user to input a value and set the value of the sent argument. Write a simple program
in which you should declare an integer variable and send it to the setValue function. Then
print out the value of the variable in the console.

Exercise 2.

Write a function called "checkIfTheSame" that will take two integer arguments. Then the 
function checks the sent arguments for:
a) equality
b) if the two arguments are completely the same (values and addresses are the same)
c) if the values are the same but the addresses are different
d) if they are completely different. 
Each condition if satisfied should print out in the screen the info about the variables. Declare 4 variables a, b, c and d. 
Variables a and b should have different values, c should be equal to a and d should be a
reference to 'a'. Then sent those variables in different combinations to the "checkIfTheSame"
function (a and b, a and c, a and d).
