Exercise 1.

Using SWITCH modify the vending machine program from the Conditional Statements. Write a program
immitating a vending machine. The program should present the user with a choice of 6 products of
your choice (Coke, Water, Chocolate Bar etc). Then allow the user to choose a product by entering
a number 1-6. Add an exception for invalid input if the user inputs a number which doesn't
correspond to any choice.

eg.

1. Cola
2. Chocolate Bar
3. ...
4. ...
5. ...
6. ...

User inputted:
Choice: 2

Output:
Your have chosen a Chocolate Bar.

eg.

User inputted:
Choice: 7

Output:
Error. Invalid choice.


Exercise 2.

Write a program that lists the months (January to December) from 1 to 12.It should ask the
user to input the number of the month. Then using switch the program answers how many days
there are in that month. In case of February, the user has to input the year (in order to
check leap year). Keep the code as short as possible !

The conditions to satisfy a leap year:

The year must be divisible by 4.
If the year is divisible by 100, then it is not a leap year.
EXCEPT if the year is divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.

eg.

User inputted:
1

Output:
This month has 31 days.

eg.

User inputted:
2

Output:
In which year ?

User Inputted:
2000

Output:
The month february has 29 days in year 2000
